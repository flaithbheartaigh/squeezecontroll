As this is a quite big job to do, I'm have made this as a open source project on
ttps://code.nokia.com/hg/SR
It is done in QT, you can get that from
ww.forum.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/

This is a complete develop env. Working quite ok. It is possible to do direct debugging in target, and getting traces from the USB.

So join in, if this is something for you.
